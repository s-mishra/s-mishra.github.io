abstract: "There  are  large  differences   in   patterns   of   per-capita   deaths   in   different   countries   that   are  difficult  to  reconcile  with  herd  immunity  arguments  but  are  easily  explained  by  the  timing  and  stringency of interventions. Seroprevalence studies  also  provide  an  independent  source  of  information  that  is  highly  consistent  with  mortality  data.  The  herd immunity argument is therefore at   odds   with   both   mortality   and   seroprevalence   data,   whereas   the   intervention   argument   provides   a   parsimonious explanation for both. 

Although  the  impacts  of  current  control interventions on transmission need  to  be  balanced  against  their  short-term  and  long-term  economic  and  health  impacts  on  society,  epidemiological  data  suggest  that  no  country  has  yet  seen  infection  rates  sufficient  to  prevent  a  second  wave  of  transmission,  should  controls  or  behavioural  precautions  be  relaxed  without  compensatory  measures  in  place."
