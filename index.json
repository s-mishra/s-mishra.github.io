In vitro, B.1.617.2 is sixfold less sensitive to serum neutralizing antibodies from recovered individuals, and eightfold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies, compared with wild-type Wuhan-1 bearing D614G. Serum neutralizing titres against B.1.617.2 were lower in ChAdOx1 vaccinees than in BNT162b2 vaccinees. B.1.617.2 spike pseudotyped viruses exhibited compromised sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies to the receptor-binding domain and the amino-terminal domain. B.1.617.2 demonstrated higher replication efficiency than B.1.1.7 in both airway organoid and human airway epithelial systems, associated with B.1.617.2 spike being in a predominantly cleaved state compared with B.1.1.7 spike. The B.1.617.2 spike protein was able to mediate highly efficient syncytium formation that was less sensitive to inhibition by neutralizing antibody, compared with that of wild-type spike. We also observed that B.1.617.2 had higher replication and spike-mediated entry than B.1.617.1, potentially explaining the B.1.617.2 dominance. In an analysis of more than 130 SARS-CoV-2-infected health care workers across three centres in India during a period of mixed lineage circulation, we observed reduced ChAdOx1 vaccine effectiveness against B.1.617.2 relative to non-B.1.617.2, with the caveat of possible residual confounding. Compromised vaccine efficacy against the highly fit and immune-evasive B.1.617.2 Delta variant warrants continued infection control measures in the post-vaccination era.","tags":[],"title":"SARS-CoV-2 B. 1.617. 2 Delta variant replication and immune evasion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mahesh S.

Simultaneously, several other VOCs were identified globally. Unlike B.1.1.7, some of these VOCs possess mutations thought to confer partial immune escape. Understanding when and how these additional VOCs pose a threat in settings where B.1.1.7 is currently dominant is vital.\nMethods We examine trends in the prevalence of non-B.1.1.7 lineages in London and other English regions using passive-case detection PCR data, cross-sectional community infection surveys, genomic surveillance, and wastewater monitoring. The study period spans from 31st January 2021 to 15th May 2021.\nFindings Across data sources, the percentage of non-B.1.1.7 variants has been increasing since late March 2021. This increase was initially driven by a variety of lineages with immune escape. From mid-April, B.1.617.2 (WHO label Delta) spread rapidly, becoming the dominant variant in England by late May.\nInterpretation The outcome of competition between variants depends on a wide range of factors such as intrinsic transmissibility, evasion of prior immunity, demographic specificities and interactions with non-pharmaceutical interventions. The presence and rise of non-B.1.1.7 variants in March likely was driven by importations and some community transmission. There was competition between non-B.1.17 variants which resulted in B.1.617.2 becoming dominant in April and May with considerable community transmission. Our results underscore that early detection of new variants requires a diverse array of data sources in community surveillance.

We define a ‘lockdown’ as a highly restrictive set of non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19, including either stay-at-home orders or interventions with an equivalent effect on movement in the population through restriction of movement. While necessarily broad, this definition encompasses the strict interventions embraced by many nations during the pandemic, particularly those that have prevented individuals from venturing outside of their homes for most reasons.\nThe claims often include the idea that the benefits of lockdowns on infection control may be outweighed by the negative impacts on the economy, social structure, education and mental health. A much stronger claim that has still persistently appeared in the media as well as peer-reviewed research concerns only health effects: that there has been a large toll of death and disease attributable directly to government action against COVID-19, a toll larger than that of COVID-19 itself. The tagline for this claim is that “the cure is worse than the disease”\nHere, we consider the claim that lockdowns cause more health harms than COVID-19 by examining their impacts on mortality, routine health services, global health programmes and suicide and mental health. We examine the evidence regarding whether government interventions are to blame for negative health consequences, or whether the lethality and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 is as much or more of a driver behind adverse health impacts. The grave harms from ineffectively mitigated epidemics have been clearly seen in places such as India and Brazil.4 Given the benefits from government intervention against COVID-19—slowing spread and preventing COVID-19 deaths—we explore whether the harms of lockdowns are likely to exceed the harms of COVID-19, or if the health harms sometimes attributed to lockdowns may instead be explained directly by the pandemic itself.","tags":[],"title":"Is the cure really worse than the disease?

Using a Bayesian semi-mechanistic model without prior assumptions on the mechanism or effectiveness of interventions, we estimate the time-varying reproduction number for the UK, Sweden and Denmark from daily mortality data. We use two approaches to evaluate counterfactuals which transpose the transmission profile from one country onto another, in each country’s first wave from 13th March (when stringent interventions began) until 1st July 2020. UK mortality would have approximately doubled had Swedish policy been adopted, while Swedish mortality would have more than halved had Sweden adopted UK or Danish strategies.

We study how five epidemiological models forecast and assess the course of the pandemic in India: a baseline curve-fitting model, an extended SIR (eSIR) model, two extended SEIR (SAPHIRE and SEIR-fansy) models, and a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model (ICM).\nMethods Using COVID-19 case-recovery-death count data reported in India from March 15 to October 15 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from October 16 to December 31. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and reported cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) for each of the five models. For reported cumulative cases and deaths, we compute Pearson’s and Lin’s correlation coefficients to investigate how well the projected and observed reported counts agree. We also present underreporting factors when available, and comment on uncertainty of projections from each model.\nResults For active case counts, SMAPE values are 35.14% (SEIR-fansy) and 37.96% (eSIR). For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 6.89% (baseline), 6.59% (eSIR), 2.25% (SAPHIRE) and 2.29% (SEIR-fansy). For cumulative death counts, the SMAPE values are 4.74% (SEIR-fansy), 8.94% (eSIR) and 0.77% (ICM). Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) cumulative case counts as well. We compute underreporting factors as of October 31 and note that for cumulative cases, the SEIR-fansy model yields an underreporting factor of 7.25 and ICM model yields 4.54 for the same quantity. For total (sum of reported and unreported) cumulative deaths the SEIR-fansy model reports an underreporting factor of 2.97. On October 31, we observe 8.18 million cumulative reported cases, while the projections (in millions) from the baseline model are 8.71 (95% credible interval: 8.63–8.80), while eSIR yields 8.35 (7.19–9.60), SAPHIRE returns 8.17 (7.90–8.52) and SEIR-fansy projects 8.51 (8.18–8.85) million cases. Cumulative case projections from the eSIR model have the highest uncertainty in terms of width of 95% credible intervals, followed by those from SAPHIRE, the baseline model and finally SEIR-fansy.\nConclusions In this comparative paper, we describe five different models used to study the transmission dynamics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus in India. While simulation studies are the only gold standard way to compare the accuracy of the models, here we were uniquely poised to compare the projected case-counts against observed data on a test period. The largest variability across models is observed in predicting the “total” number of infections including reported and unreported cases (on which we have no validation data). The degree of under-reporting has been a major concern in India and is characterized in this report. Overall, the SEIR-fansy model appeared to be a good choice with publicly available R-package and desired flexibility plus accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"A comparison of five epidemiological models for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Konrad Krawczyk","Tadeusz Chelkowski","Daniel J Laydon","Swapnil Mishra","Denise Xifara","Seth Flaxman","Thomas Mellan","Veit Schwämmle","Richard Röttger","Johannes T Hadsund","Samir Bhatt"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1622609320,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622609320,"objectID":"658e0a6ead214a9cc4858a7f3be900f5","permalink":"https://s-mishra.github.io/publication/jmir-21/","publishdate":"2022-01-03T10:18:40+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/jmir-21/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Before the advent of an effective vaccine, nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and lockdowns, have been the primary measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Such measures are highly effective when there is high population-wide adherence, which requires information on current risks posed by the pandemic alongside a clear exposition of the rules and guidelines in place.\nObjective: Here we analyzed online news media coverage of COVID-19. We quantified the total volume of COVID-19 articles, their sentiment polarization, and leading subtopics to act as a reference to inform future communication strategies.\nMethods: We collected 26 million news articles from the front pages of 172 major online news sources in 11 countries (available online at SciRide). Using topic detection, we identified COVID-19–related content to quantify the proportion of total coverage the pandemic received in 2020. The sentiment analysis tool Vader was employed to stratify the emotional polarity of COVID-19 reporting. Further topic detection and sentiment analysis was performed on COVID-19 coverage to reveal the leading themes in pandemic reporting and their respective emotional polarizations.\nResults: We found that COVID-19 coverage accounted for approximately 25.3% of all front-page online news articles between January and October 2020. Sentiment analysis of English-language sources revealed that overall COVID-19 coverage was not exclusively negatively polarized, suggesting wide heterogeneous reporting of the pandemic. Within this heterogenous coverage, 16% of COVID-19 news articles (or 4% of all English-language articles) can be classified as highly negatively polarized, citing issues such as death, fear, or crisis.\nConclusions: The goal of COVID-19 public health communication is to increase understanding of distancing rules and to maximize the impact of governmental policy. The extent to which the quantity and quality of information from different communication channels (eg, social media, government pages, and news) influence public understanding of public health measures remains to be established. Here we conclude that a quarter of all reporting in 2020 covered COVID-19, which is indicative of information overload. In this capacity, our data and analysis form a quantitative basis for informing health communication strategies along traditional news media channels to minimize the risks of COVID-19 while vaccination is rolled out.","tags":[],"title":"Quantifying Online News Media Coverage of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Text Mining Study and Resource","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Swapnil Mishra*","Nuno R.

We find that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S-gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Analysis of trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers in local areas across England shows that the VOC has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if the VOC has a different latent period or generation time. The SGTF data indicate a transient shift in the age composition of reported cases, with a larger share of under 20 year olds among reported VOC than non-VOC cases. Time-varying reproduction numbers for the VOC and cocirculating lineages were estimated using SGTF and genomic data. The best supported models did not indicate a substantial difference in VOC transmissibility among different age groups.

As COVID19 disease control efforts are re-intensified, understanding the age demographics driving transmission and how these affect the loosening of interventions is crucial. We analyze aggregated, age-specific mobility trends from more than 10 million individuals in the US and link these mechanistically to age-specific COVID-19 mortality data. We estimate that as of October 2020, individuals aged 20-49 are the only age groups sustaining resurgent SARS-CoV-2 transmission with reproduction numbers well above one, and that at least 65 of 100 COVID-19 infections originate from individuals aged 20-49 in the US. Targeting interventions – including transmission-blocking vaccines – to adults aged 20-49 is an important consideration in halting resurgent epidemics and preventing COVID-19-attributable deaths.","tags":[],"title":"Age groups that sustain resurging COVID-9 epidemics in the United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Iwona Hawryluk","Thomas A.

We determine epidemiological distributions for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 using a large dataset (N = 21 000 − 157 000) from the Brazilian Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe database. A joint Bayesian subnational model with partial pooling is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between 11.2 and 17.8 days across the different states, and a mean of 15.2 days for Brazil. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability density function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalized lognormal for onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.","tags":[],"title":"Inference of COVID-19 epidemiological distributions from Brazilian hospital data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Swapnil Mishra*","H.

This was the first COVID-19 death detected in Italy since the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days. We collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo’ at two consecutive time points. From the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1–3.3%). From the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI: 0.8–1.8%). Notably, 42.5% (95% CI: 31.5–54.6%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic (that is, did not have symptoms at the time of swab testing and did not develop symptoms afterwards). The mean serial interval was 7.2 days (95% CI: 5.9–9.6). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (P = 0.62 and 0.74 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, exact Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test).

In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closure of schools and national lockdowns. We study the impact of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of COVID-19 until the 4th of May 2020 when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries with both individual and shared effects on the reproduction number. Pooling allows more information to be used, helps overcome data idiosyncrasies, and enables more timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters such as the infection fatality rate, does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in the reproduction number are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behavior. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that is incomplete, with systematic biases in reporting, and subject to future consolidation. We estimate that, for all the countries we consider, current interventions have been sufficient to drive the reproduction number Rt below 1 (probability Rt\u003c 1.0 is 99.9%) and achieve epidemic control. We estimate that, across all 11 countries, between 12 and 15 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4th May, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population.

Thus, understanding and predicting the popularity of online information is an important  problem in social media analysis. Considerable progress has been made recently in data-driven predictions, and in linking popularity to various external factors. Most of the work on popularity  prediction and understanding is either based on learning a variety of features from full network data or using generative processes to model the event time data. However, there exists no prior work that connects or compares models across different paradigms. Accordingly, this thesis focuses on developing and connecting models to predict and understand popularity across different paradigms and settings. To this aim, we first bridge gaps between feature-driven and generative models with the help of a hybrid model and a new performance benchmark. We model each social diffusion with a marked Hawkes self-exciting point process, and we estimate from data the content virality, memory decay, and user influence. Next, we learn a predictive layer for popularity prediction using a collection of cascade histories. We show the Hawkes process with a predictive overlay outperforms recent feature-driven and generative approaches on both existing tweets data and our new dataset. We also show that a feature-driven method based on a basic set of user features and event time summary statistics performs competitively in both classification and regression tasks and that adding point process information to the feature set further improves predictions. A common benchmark dataset for popularity prediction helps us to utilize both feature-driven, and generative paradigms to better predict and understand online popularity. As the first proposed work that links models across feature-driven and generative models, our work has influenced subsequent works on online popularity since its publication in 2016. Secondly, we identify that the existing methods for popularity modeling and prediction typically focus on a single source of external influence. However, for many types of online content such as YouTube videos or news articles, attention is driven by multiple heterogeneous sources simultaneously - e.g., microblogs and traditional media coverage. Correspondingly, we propose RNN-MAS, a recurrent neural network for modeling asynchronous streams. It is a sequence generator that connects multiple streams of different granularity via joint inference. We show that RNN-MAS not only outperforms the current state-of-the-art YouTube popularity prediction system, but it also captures complex dynamics, such as the seasonal trends of unseen influence. Further, to increase the explainability and interpretability of our model, we propose two new metrics: the {promotionresponse} quantifies the gain in popularity from one unit of promotion for a YouTube video; the {loudness level} captures the effects of a particular user tweeting about the video. We use the loudness level to compare the effects of a video being promoted by a single highly-followed user (in the top 1% most followed users) against the same video being promoted by a group of mid-followed users. We show that results depend on the type of content being promoted: superusers are more successful in promoting Howto and Gaming videos, whereas the cohort of regular users is more influential for Activism videos. Additionally, we apply the RNN-MAS model to the problem of predicting the popularity of an item before being published. We train a single model for a group of videos to learn possible evolution dynamics of a given video from the historical data of the videos in the same group. A novel simulation strategy based on the proposed metrics enables us to simulate a representative promotion for the video, and predict the achieved popularity before it is published. Experiments on our large scale YouTube dataset show that our proposed method outperforms non-trivial baselines. By and large, this thesis proposes models for popularity modeling and prediction that are the first of their kind, and it links models across various paradigms and data availability. This work provides accurate and explainable popularity predictions, as well as computational tools for content producers and marketers to allocate resources for promotion campaigns. In addition to these contributions, this work may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of popularity prediction and understanding models across different classes or types.","tags":[],"title":"Linking Models for Collective Attention in Social Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Swapnil Mishra"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1549825305,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549825305,"objectID":"9aba84249b94cd1765ef39835db48645","permalink":"https://s-mishra.github.io/publication/wsdm-19/","publishdate":"2019-11-12T14:58:50Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wsdm-19/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding and predicting the popularity of online items is an important open problem in social media analysis.

This work provides more accurate and explainable popularity predictions, as well as computational tools for content producers and marketers to allocate resources for promotion campaigns.","tags":[],"title":"Hawkes Processes for Events in Social Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marian-Andrei Rizoiu","Swapnil Mishra","Quyu Kong","Mark Carman","Lexing Xie"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1509908531,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509908531,"objectID":"1f82843abef1bd02eb0b43b4eef02c18","permalink":"https://s-mishra.github.io/publication/dubww-18/","publishdate":"2019-11-12T15:38:43Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dubww-18/","section":"publication","summary":"Among the statistical tools for online information diffusion modeling, both epidemic models and Hawkes point processes are popular choices. The former originate from epidemiology, and consider information as a viral contagion which spreads into a population of online users. The latter have roots in geophysics and finance, view individual actions as discrete events in continuous time, and modulate the rate of events according to the self-exciting nature of event sequences. Here, we establish a novel connection between these two frameworks. Namely, the rate of events in an extended Hawkes model is identical to the rate of new infections in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model after marginalizing out recovery events -- which are unobserved in a Hawkes process. This result paves the way to apply tools developed for SIR to Hawkes, and vice versa. It also leads to HawkesN, a generalization of the Hawkes model which accounts for a finite population size. Finally, we derive the distribution of cascade sizes for HawkesN, inspired by methods in stochastic SIR. Such distributions provide nuanced explanations to the general unpredictability of popularity: the distribution for diffusion cascade sizes tends to have two modes, one corresponding to large cascade sizes and another one around zero.","tags":[],"title":"SIR-Hawkes: Linking Epidemic Models and Hawkes Processes to Model Diffusions in Finite Populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Swapnil Mishra","Marian-Andrei Rizoiu","Lexing Xie"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1477285440,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477285440,"objectID":"3de2ea74fc35c42c8376565cec0f5962","permalink":"https://s-mishra.github.io/publication/cikm-16/","publishdate":"2019-11-12T14:57:50Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cikm-16/","section":"publication","summary":"Predicting popularity, or the total volume of information outbreaks, is an important subproblem for understanding collective behavior in networks. Each of the two main types of recent approaches to the problem, feature-driven and generative models, have desired qualities and clear limitations. This paper bridges the gap between these solutions with a new hybrid approach and a new performance benchmark. We model each social cascade with a marked Hawkes self-exciting point process, and estimate the content virality, memory decay, and user influence. We then learn a predictive layer for popularity prediction using a collection of cascade history. To our surprise, Hawkes process with a predictive overlay outperform recent feature-driven and generative approaches on existing tweet data [44] and a new public benchmark on news tweets. We also found that a basic set of user features and event time summary statistics performs competitively in both classification and regression tasks, and that adding point process information to the feature set further improves predictions. From these observations, we argue that future work on popularity prediction should compare across feature-driven and generative modeling approaches in both classification and regression tasks.","tags":[],"title":"Feature Driven and Point Process Approaches for Popularity Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wray L.

For information retrieval, language models exhibiting word burstiness are important. Indeed, this burstiness effect has been show to help topic models as well, and this requires additional word probability vectors for each document. Here we show how to combine these ideas to develop high-performing non-parametric topic models exhibiting burstiness based on standard Gibbs sampling. Experiments are done to explore the behavior of the models under different conditions and to compare the algorithms with previously published. The full non-parametric topic models with burstiness are only a small factor slower than standard Gibbs sampling for LDA and require double the memory, making them very competitive. We look at the comparative behaviour of different models and present some experimental insights.","tags":[],"title":"Experiments with non-parametric topic models","type":"publication"}]
